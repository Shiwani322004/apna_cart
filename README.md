# 🚀 Say hello to React! 
Kickstarting my journey with React — the library that makes building UIs a breeze!

Hi! 👋 This project was created using **Create React App**, a great tool to quickly set up a modern React project with zero configuration.

---

## 📁 Available Scripts

Once you're inside the project directory, you can use the following commands in the terminal:

### ▶️ `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode.  
Just visit 👉 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see it in action.  
Any changes you make will reload the page automatically! 🔁  
Errors or warnings (if any) will be shown in the console.

---

### 🧪 `npm test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.  
You can write and run unit tests to ensure your components work properly.

---

### 📦 `npm run build`

Bundles the app into static files for production.  
It will create a `build` folder with optimized code that’s ready to be deployed.  
File names will include hashes for cache-busting and better performance.

---

### 💣 `npm run eject` (optional)

**Be careful!** This command will give you full control over the configuration (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc).  
It’s a **one-way operation** — once you eject, you can’t go back.  
But you usually won’t need it unless you want deep customizations.
